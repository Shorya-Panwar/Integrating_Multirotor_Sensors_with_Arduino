# Integrating_Multirotor_Sensors_with_Arduino
Integrated and Calibrated Ultrasonic and Gyroscopic sensors using Arduino for a multirotor. Also added a functionality to measure the multirotor's velocity using 2 quick pulses by calculating change in distance of obstacle and the time between the two pulses.

Was awarded the Top 5 Project award by IIT Roorkee out of more than 350 teams due to this innovative functionality and efforts made on calibration.
